# polyCID

polyCID is an user friendly R app based on preprocessed GBS data for detection and classification of putative contaminants in biparental polyploid progenies, including apomictic clones, self-fertilization, half-siblings and/or full contaminants individuals. You can explore our simulated data to learn how to interact with the tool, as well as access and modify all datasets to adapt them to your research needs. By going through the workflow below, you can become familiar with all the steps involved in the analysis.
